  "summary": "The diff implements the majority of the requested requirements (REQ-13 through REQ-17). REQ-17 backend changes are present (gameUrl field, migration, addGame), REQ-14 category filter bar is implemented, REQ-15 leaderboard with refresh button and score submission form is implemented, REQ-16 UI polish (hover effects, featured games, top player ticker, page transitions, loading progress bar) is implemented. However, several specific acceptance criteria have gaps: the backend seeding of at least 2 games per sport category is not evidenced in the diff, and the migration only sets gameUrl to empty string rather than a meaningful default placeholder URL.",
