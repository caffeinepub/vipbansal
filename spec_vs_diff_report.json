  "summary": "The diff implements all five requirements (REQ-39 through REQ-43) with good coverage. Backend adds Racing, Badminton, and Shooting categories with pre-populated game entries. Frontend adds filter buttons, updates the homepage hero, creates a TermsPage, registers the /terms route, and adds a Terms & Conditions footer link. One minor concern: the build request requires three specific generated images for the new sport category icons, which are not mentioned anywhere in the diff.",

      "requirement": "Racing sport category icon illustration (racing-category-icon.dim_256x256.png), Badminton sport category icon illustration (badminton-category-icon.dim_256x256.png), and Shooting sport category icon illustration (shooting-category-icon.dim_256x256.png) must be generated as image assets",
      "reason": "The build request explicitly lists three required images. None of these image files appear anywhere in the diff summary — no files were added under assets/generated or any other path for these icons.",

      "description": "A backend/migration.mo module was added to handle schema migration from OldSportCategory to NewSportCategory with full data conversion logic for games and player scores.",
      "reason": "The build request does not mention any migration module or migration strategy. The requirement only asks to update backend category validation/enums and pre-populate game entries in the single backend/main.mo actor file. Creating a separate migration.mo file was not requested.",
